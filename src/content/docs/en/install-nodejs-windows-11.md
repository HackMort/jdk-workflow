*We need to use Node js to improve our development workflow and achieve all our goals in less time*

Here'is how you can do:

1. ✅ First, go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">the official Node.js website</a> and download the latest version of Node.js for Windows. Make sure to select the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
2. ✅ Once the download is complete, double-click the downloaded file to begin the installation process.
3. ✅ In the Node.js Setup Wizard, click "Next" to begin the installation process.
4. ✅ Read and accept the terms of the license agreement, and then click "Next".
5. ✅ Choose the installation location for Node.js, or leave the default location, and then click "Next".
6. ✅ Choose the components to install. We recommend selecting the "npm package manager" option, which will allow you to easily manage Node.js packages using the npm command-line tool. Then click "Next".
7. ✅ Choose the start menu folder for Node.js shortcuts, or leave the default folder, and then click "Next".
8. ✅ Review your installation choices, and then click "Install" to begin the installation process.
9. ✅ Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a few minutes.
10. ✅ Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to exit the Node.js Setup Wizard.

**That's it! You've now successfully installed Node.js on your Windows 11 system. You can now start using Node.js and npm to build and run applications on your computer.**
