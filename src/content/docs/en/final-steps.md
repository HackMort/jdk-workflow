Once we have finished creating the pages, we need to make sure that the website is ready for production. This includes making sure that the website is accessible, responsive, and optimized for search engines.

One thing to keep in mind is that the website is not ready for production until the client has approved it. This is why we make sure that the client is happy with the website before we move on to the next step.

Here we tackle all changes, updates, and fixes that the client may request. Internally we call them ***"feedback"***. 

We have a couple of rounds of ***"feedback"***, where we make sure that the Website is going in the right direction.

## Accessibility
During the project, we make sure that the website is accessible by following the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). This includes making sure that the website is usable by people with disabilities, such as people who are blind, have low vision, have color blindness, or have motor impairments.

One thing to keep in mind is that accessibility is not only for people with disabilities. It also helps people who are using mobile devices, people who are using a slow internet connection, and people who are using a screen reader.

## SEO
We make sure that the website is optimized for search engines by following the [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) best practices. This includes adding the correct metadata to the website, such as the title, description, and keywords. We also make sure that the website is using the correct HTML tags, such as the `<h1>` tag for the main title, the `<h2>` tag for the subheadings, and the `<p>` tag for the paragraphs.

## Changes & Feedback
Once the client has approved the latest version of the website, we move on to the next step ***[Sitecore Migration](#sitecore)***.

## Sitecore
As a Frontend Developer, we don't usually work on the Sitecore side of the project. However, we do need to make sure that the website is ready to be migrated to Sitecore.

We work with the Backend Team helping them with the migration process or with any issues that may arise during the migration.

## Final Thoughts
This is the end of the Frontend Developer's journey. We have learned how to create a website from scratch, from setting up the file structure and HTML layout to applying styles and optimizing for mobile devices. We have also learned how to make sure that the website is ready for production.

All that's left to do is to celebrate our success! ðŸŽ‰
