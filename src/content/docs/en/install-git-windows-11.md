*To use Git on your Windows 11 computer, you'll need to install Git and Git Bash. Git is a cool version control system that helps you manage your code projects easily. Git Bash is a command-line interface that lets you run Git commands and other Unix-like commands on Windows.*

**Here's how to get started:**

1. ✅ First, head over to the <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">official Git website</a> and click Download. This will take you to the downloads page where you can find the latest version of Git for Windows. Click on it to download the setup file.
2. ✅ Next, double-click the setup file to run it. You'll see a series of screens where you can customize your installation options. You can leave most of them as default, but make sure you select "Git Bash Here" in the context menu options screen. This way, you can easily open Git Bash from any folder by right-clicking on it.
3. ✅ Finally, click Install and wait for the installation to finish. You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

That's it! You've successfully installed Git and Git Bash on Windows 11. To test if they work, open a folder where you want to create or clone a repository, right-click on it, and select "Git Bash Here". A terminal window will pop up where you can type git --version to see if Git is installed correctly.

**You can also try typing other Git commands or Unix-like commands like ls, pwd, cd, etc.**
